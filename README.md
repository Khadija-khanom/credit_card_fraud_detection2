This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.
Attribute	Representation

**Unnamed:**0	 An index column, possibly representing a unique identifier for each row

**trans_date_trans_time:** The date and time of the transaction

**cc_num:** 	The credit card number used for the transaction

**merchant:**	The name of the merchant where the transaction took place

**category:**	The category of the transaction (e.g., grocery, travel, etc.)
amt	The amount of the transaction

**first:**	The first name of the cardholder

**last:**	The last name of the cardholder

**gender:**	The gender of the cardholder

**street:**	The street address of the cardholder

**city:**	The city of the cardholder

**state:**	The state of the cardholder

**zip:**	The zip code of the cardholder

**lat:**	The latitude of the cardholder's location

**long:**	The longitude of the cardholder's location

**city_pop:**	The population of the city where the cardholder resides

**job:**	The occupation or job title of the cardholder

**dob:**	The date of birth of the cardholder

**trans_num:**	A unique identifier for each transaction

**unix_time:** 	The transaction time in UNIX timestamp format

**merch_lat:**	The latitude of the merchant's location

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this study is to build and evaluate predictive models capable of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy, while minimizing false positives and false negatives. This involves the application of various machine learning and deep learning techniques to effectively handle the imbalanced nature of the dataset and capture intricate patterns associated with fraudulent activities.
